#Idea for the project :
Using WebApp Factory to run UI Tests with Selenium which hosts a website in memory and eliminates the need to spin up an environment. Advancement to this can be running the tests in Circle CI pipeline. 

#Pre Requisite:
If you try to run without the webdriver, you need this:
npm install -g selenium-standalone@latest
selenium-standalone install


#Current State:
Code is checked in
Code is built
Code is deployed to a mock environment 
Tool is used to run UI against code/environment


#How the project executes ?
Web Project - Atlas Service with a Page
Selenium Test runs against Page
Web App Factory Hosting *
